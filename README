Classic - Seam 2 Bridge for Java EE 7
=====================================
Ported to WildFly 9.0.1.Final
Dependencies: DeltaSpike 1.5 Core/Servlet, Weld 2, Javassist 3, Reflections 0.9
Restrictions: 
- the @RequestParameter injection points don`t support automatic type coercion (only Strings will be injected).
- the synchronization behavior (explicit and built-in) is taken over from Seam 2.3 (Stateful and Stateless EJBs are synchronized by container)
